        <p class="synopsis-blurb">
          Bluffing is the story of Eric and Marissa, a young married couple who
          are currently estranged after Eric was caught with a prostitute. When
          the movie starts, Marissa has agreed to meet Eric in a bar so that he
          can give his side of the story. But what at first seems like a
          standard “it’s not what it looks like” speech quickly takes on new
          meaning as Eric explains his shocking motives for hiring a sex worker.
        </p>

        <p class="synopsis-blurb">
          According to Eric, he has been secretly harboring homicidal tendencies
          since he was a child, culminating in his decision to hire a prostitute
          in order to, as he puts it, “get it out of his system.” But Marissa
          isn't having it. Believing he is attempting to cover up his infidelity
          with an outlandish misdirection, Marissa challenges him to prove he
          has homicidal tendencies by performing an actual murder.
        </p>

        <p class="synopsis-blurb">
          In response, Eric, believing that Marissa is merely trying to expose
          and embarrass him, insists that she help him with the murder, thus
          preventing her from going to the cops once she sees he’s telling the
          truth. And from that point on, we watch as Eric and Marissa play a
          veritable game of chicken, each pushing the other closer and closer to
          the point of no return.
